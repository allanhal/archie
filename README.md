## Getting Started

```bash
yarn && yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Requirements:

- [x] Should a be NextJs project
      Using create-next-app is fine
- [x] Should use typescript
- [x] Use SpaceX’s graphql api to query the data required to build the exercise
- [x] The final result of this should be stored in a git repository and shared with Archie via
      email - https://github.com/allanhal/archie

Stretch Ideas:

- [x] Preferably use chakra ui for styled-components
- [x] Add a search bar that can filter through missions and only display the ones that
      match the current search entry
- [x] Use one of the server-side functions NextJS provides to fetch data or explain why
      you didn’t use this method - Used to fetch the latest news about Spacex (using a REST API)
- [x] Use apollo graphql to establish a connection to the endpoint
- [x] Make it mobile responsive
- [x] Deploy to free hosting such as Vercel/Netlify and send the link at the time of
      submission - https://archie-allanhal.vercel.app/
- [x] Feel free to also implement features that you think we’d find interesting on top of the
      requirements - Latest news on the bottom
